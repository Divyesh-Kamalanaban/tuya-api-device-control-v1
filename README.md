## Control your device remotely within your desktop
* Now, click on the API Explorer in the left navigation menu.
* You should see a Dashboard similar to this:

![GitHub Logo](/Tuya-img9.png)

* Go to Device Control > Get the instruction set support and paste the device id into the device-id textbox. Then, click on submit request.
* You should see a response window, similar to this:

![GitHub Logo](/Tuya-img10.png)

* Now, from the above response, we'll use the <code>"name": "switch 1"</code> function, and use the True or False values for the input.
* The reason why we use True/False here is that, the function only accepts these values, or simply Boolean values (Data type). Boolean values are basically Yes or No, or True or False.
* Now, go to Device Control > Control Device. 
* Enter your device id and paste the following code on commands textbox:
<code>[{"code":"switch_1","value":true}]</code>
* This may be applicable only for Smart Plugs. For other devices, it may vary accordingly. 
* What this does is that, it switches on your smart device. In my case, it did.
* You should have a response similar to this:

<code>{
  "result": true,
  "success": true,
  "t": 1624808513836
}</code>

* Congratulations, you have successfully controlled your smart device remotely from your desktop. You can do than this. For other info, visit Tuya's documentation for more details.
